Social/legislative/economic developments that have impacted the employment and labour market and new legislation
Expatriate employment levy
On 27 February 2024 the federal government launched the expatriate employment levy handbook (“handbook”), which introduced the expatriate employment levy (“levy”).  Whilst the levy is a government mandated contribution imposed on employers who employ expatriate workers in Nigeria, the handbook contains guidelines for the implementation of the levy.   The objectives of the levy as contained in the handbook are to (a) promote skill transfer and knowledge sharing, (b) balance economic growth and social welfare, (c) enhance collaboration between public and private sectors, and (d) address demographic shifts.
Expatriate workers subject to the levy are persons who are non-citizens of Nigeria but are employed within Nigeria and may also include individuals on specific types of work permits, visas, or other temporary residency arrangements.  Accredited staff of diplomatic missions and government officials are, however, exempted from the levy. The levy is applicable to the private sector industries that utilise foreign workforce or rely on expatriate labour.  Thus, any company or organisation that engages the services of expatriate workers is liable to pay the levy.  The levy, which is to be paid annually, is US$10,000 for non-director expatriates and US$15,000 for director expatriates.  Employers are however entitled to deduct the levy as a business operating cost.
Although the effective date of implementation of the levy was 15 March 2024, on 8 March 2024 the federal government announced the suspension of the implementation of the levy to enable the government to engage in further consultation and dialogue with stakeholders who raised some concerns regarding implementation of the levy.
Implementation of the Oronsaye report
On 26 February 2024, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu directed the full implementation of the Oronsaye report (“report”).  The report is named after Mr. Stephen Oronsaye, a former head of service of the federation, who chaired the Presidential Committee on the Rationalisation and Restructuring of Federal Government Parastatals, Commissions, and Agencies (“Oronsaye committee”).  The Orosanye committee was inaugurated by the Nigerian government in 2011 to conduct a review and make recommendations for the rationalisation and restructuring of federal government parastatals, commissions, and agencies.  In 2012, the Oronsaye committee presented the report in which it recommended, among others, the reduction of the number of statutory agencies from 263 to 161, the scrapping of 38 agencies, the merger of 52, and the reversion of 14 agencies to departments in various ministries.  The potential impact of this would be the reduction of cost of governance, the streamlining of operations of the federal government and enhancement of efficiency across the government value chain, the elimination of redundancy, and the optimisation of Nigeria’s resources.
Although there have been failed attempts  to implement the report, the federal government, following the President’s directive on 26 February 2024, inaugurated a 10-member implementation committee to, among others, (a) review the mandates of government agencies to understand the existing functions, responsibilities, and objectives of the agencies, (b) identify redundancies and overlaps or conflicting objectives in the mandates, (c) draft revised mandates for the relevant agencies/bodies, (d) obtain approvals from the relevant authorities for the revised mandates, and (e) communicate the revised mandates to employees and stakeholders.
Whilst the report is a landmark document in Nigeria’s pursuit for administrative reform and effective governance, the implementation of the report has faced various challenges, including the need to amend or repeal the legislation that established the agencies.  Civil servants who perceive the report as a threat to their employments have criticised the implementation of the report.  There are also concerns relating to the implementation of the report because it does not contemplate the agencies that were created in the country after the Oronsaye committee presented the report in 2012.  We also note that the report does not address some of the issues affecting the cost and quality of governance, such as the size and remuneration of the political class, economic diversification, and infrastructure deficit.
Removal of subsidy on premium motor spirit
Following President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s announcement of the removal of subsidy on premium motor spirit (“PMS”) on 29 May 2023 and the resultant increase in the price of PMS and other commodities, the Nigeria Labour Congress (“NLC”) threatened to embark on a strike.  Based on this, the federal government commenced negotiations with NLC and the Trade Union Congress (“TUC”) to find ways to cushion the effect of the subsidy removal.  The federal government also (a) instituted
Federal Government of Nigeria & anor v NLC & ors
(Suit No. NICN/ABH/158/2023) (“first suit”) at the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (“NICN”) against NLC and TUC (“Unions”), and (b) obtained an interim order in the first suit against the Unions restraining them from embarking on the intended strike and/or industrial action pending the hearing of the application for interlocutory injunction against them.  The Unions, however, filed an application to set aside the interim order.  The parties subsequently resolved to settle the matter amicably out-of-court.
Further to the amicable settlement, on 2 October 2023 the federal government and the Unions executed a memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) to resolve some of the issues raised by the Unions relating to the removal of subsidy on PMS.  In the MoU, the federal government undertook, among others, to (a) grant a wage award of
N
35,000 to all federal government workers beginning from September 2023 and pending the implementation of a new national minimum wage, (b) suspend the collection of value-added tax on diesel for six months commencing from October 2023, (c) vote
N
100 billion for the provision of high capacity CNG buses for mass transit in Nigeria, (d) implement various tax incentive measures in the private and public sectors, (e) pay to 15 million households, including vulnerable pensioners,
N
25,000 per month for three months commencing from October 2023, and (f) increase its initiatives on subsidised distribution of fertilizers to farmers across the country.
However, following the delay by the federal government to implement the MoU, the NLC once again threatened to embark on a strike for which the federal government on 10 November 2023 instituted
Federal Government of Nigeria & anor v NLC & ors
(Suit No. NICN/ABH/322/2023) (“second suit”) against the Unions, notwithstanding the pendency of the first suit.  The federal government also obtained an interim order of injunction in the second suit restraining the Unions from embarking on a strike or other industrial action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, on 27 and 28 February 2024 the NLC embarked on a two-day nation-wide peaceful protest due to the rate of inflation in the country.
Uniformity of the retirement age and pension benefits of judicial officers
On 8 June 2023 President Bola Ahmed Tinubu signed into law the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (Fifth Alteration, No. 37) Act 2023 (“Amendment Act”).  The Amendment Act raised the retirement age of judges of the State High Courts, Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, Customary Courts of Appeal, and Sharia Courts of Appeal from 65 to 70 years, thereby making the retirement age of the judges in these courts the same as the retirement age of the justices of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  The Amendment Act also provides uniform pension benefits for all judges and justices of superior courts in Nigeria.
IPOB sit-at-home orders
Following the arrest, detention, and prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu, a pro-Biafra activist and leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (“IPOB”) for sundry alleged offences, IPOB, as a way of showing solidarity and support for its leader, issued and enforced various “sit-at-home” orders in the five states in South-East  Nigeria.  However, whilst the enforcement of the sit-at-home order on Mondays is no longer as intensive and extensive as it used to be, activities have not returned to usual levels in some major cities in South-East Nigeria.  The overall effect is that economic activities in South-East Nigeria remain subdued by reason of insecurity, resulting in job losses in the region.
Bill against casualisation of labour
The Prohibition of Casualisation in Nigeria (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB,329) for an Act to provide for the prohibition of casualisation in all forms of employment in the private and public sector in Nigeria and for related matters was introduced in the Senate of the National Assembly as a private member bill in March 2020.  The objective of the Bill is to impose a legal duty on employers of labour both in public and private sector establishments to convert casual employment to permanent status after three months of engagement.  The Bill, which was read for the second time on the floor of the Senate on 18 February 2021, has been referred to the Senate Committee on Employment, Labour and Productivity for further legislative action.  The Bill will thereafter be read for the third time on the floor of the Senate, following which the Senate may pass or not pass the Bill.  However, the Bill may eventually become law if it is also passed by the House of Representatives and assented to by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (unless the refusal to grant assent is vetoed).
The NICN has set the pace for the eradication of casualisation of labour by recognising the right of casual workers to join trade unions just as permanent workers.  In
Patovilki Industrial Planners Limited v National Union of Hotels and Personal Services Workers
(Suit No. NICN/12/89) Digest of Judgments of National Industrial Court (1978–2006) p 288–289, the NICN held that both permanent and casual workers have the right to form a trade union.  NICN concluded by saying that section 1 (1) of the Trade Unions Act, allows workers, whether permanent or temporary, to form a trade union and a relevant trade union can unionise workers who are casual daily paid workers.  In this case, the appellant company conducts the business of industrial cleaning, while the respondent is a registered trade union.  The union sought permission to unionise the appellant’s workers, however, the company refused on the basis that they were casual workers.  The respondent therefore declared a trade dispute.  The Industrial Arbitration Panel (“IAP”) heard the dispute and gave an award in favour of the respondent union.  The appellant, being dissatisfied, appealed to the NICN, which upheld the ruling of the IAP in July 1990.
Further, placing reliance on the definition of “employee” in the Employees’ Compensation Act, the NICN extended the definition of an “employee” to include persons engaged on a temporary or casual basis in
Abel v Trevi Foundation Nigeria Ltd
(unreported 2014 decision of the NICN in Suit No.: NICN/PHC/55/2013 delivered on 26 June 2014).  In that case, the NICN held that the claimant, a contract staff who sustained injuries in the course of his employment, was an employee of the defendant and therefore entitled to compensation for injuries sustained in the course of his employment with the defendant.
Bill to amend the Labour Act
The Labour Act, L1 LFN 2004 (Amendment) Bill 2021 (SB. 469) was also introduced in the Senate of the National Assembly as a private member bill.  The Bill seeks to amend the provisions of the Labour Act relating to fines, which have become obsolete and no longer reflect current economic realities in Nigeria.  It has progressed to the committee stage and will thereafter be read for the third time on the floor of the Senate, following which the Senate may or may not pass the Bill.  The Bill may eventually become law if it is also passed by the House of Representatives and assented to by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (unless the refusal to grant assent is vetoed).
Depreciation in the value of the Naira
The consistent depreciation in the value of the Naira has triggered economic challenges for businesses, which have continued to adversely affect the labour market.  The consequences of this have been dire for the employment and labour market. Major multinational corporations like Proctor & Gamble and GlaxoSmithKline have exited the country, resulting in over 10,000 job losses.  In addition, firms like Unilever and Shell are restructuring their Nigerian operations, indicating a broader reassessment of Nigeria’s business environment with a potentially more adverse impact on the labour market.
Trends in volume and types of employment claims over the last year and possible causes
There has been an increase in claims for redundancy benefits and wrongful termination of employment arising from continuing termination of employments, sometimes occasioned by sluggish economic growth, including a slowdown in activities in the oil and gas sector – a major driver of Nigeria’s economy.
Trends and issues related to hybrid, flexible and remote working arrangements
One of the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria is the adoption of the remote working system.  According to the ILO, 52% of Nigerian enterprises reported that employees worked remotely during the pandemic.  In the last three years, these structures have become the norm.
Redundancies/reductions in force, business transfers and reorganisations
Legal considerations and best practice in implementing redundancies/reductions in force
Implementation of redundancies is regulated by law, regulations, court decisions, employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and/or international best practices as contained in various international conventions.
Generally, the best practice in implementing redundancies include: (a) notification to the employees’ representative or affected employees (as the case may be) of the redundancy, and the reason(s) for, and extent of, the redundancy.  The notice should also indicate the process and time for consultation; and if redundancy pay has not been pre-agreed, a commitment to make the appropriate redundancy payment; (b) consultation with the affected employees on the measures to (i) be taken to avert or minimise the resultant terminations on ground of redundancy, and (ii) minimise the adverse effect of the eventual terminations on the affected employees (if available).  The employer may also during the consultation offer an additional
ex gratia
payment to the affected staff, especially if the employer intends to obtain a waiver of all present and future claims from each affected employee to eliminate the chance of post-implementation litigation; and (c) entering into a simple separation and release agreement with each of the affected employees, especially for the purpose of obtaining a waiver of all present and future claims from each affected employee.
For employees covered by the Labour Act, the “last in, first out” principle will be adopted in the discharge of the employee in addition to the foregoing, subject however to all factors of relative merit, including skill, ability and reliability.  The Labour Act applies to “workers”, which is defined to mean a person employed to do manual labour or clerical work but excludes, amongst others, persons exercising administrative, executive, technical or professional functions.  These are employees who are generally called “unskilled” or “junior” staff.
Relevant test for business transfer legislation to apply
Nigerian law does not recognise the transfer of employees by operation of law (
Re Bendel Line Co. Ltd.
(1979) 5 FRCLR 19) following a business transfer from one owner to another.  Specifically, for employments governed by the Labour Act, section 10 thereof subjects the transfer of employment from one employer to another by consent of the worker and the endorsement of the transfer by an authorised labour officer.  Thus, a transfer of an employee’s employment will only be effective when the employee consents to it.  However, notwithstanding that Nigerian law does not recognise the transfer of employees by operation of law, termination payment obligations of a previous employer may pass to a person who succeeds the business from the previous employer, and transfers the undertaking for which the employees were engaged to the successor for instance, in acquisitions, takeover, privatisation, outsourcing, etc.  Such termination payment obligations will pass to the successor entity where a merger is such that one of the merging companies is restructured to accommodate the new business while the other is dissolved; or in a manner that results in the fusion of the merging entities into an altogether new company that inherits the business and obligations of the merging entities.
Process for electing employee representatives
The primary legislation on employee representation in Nigeria is the Trade Union Act (“TUA”), enacted in 1973.  Unions represent their members.  Once a union is registered under the TUA, it has the right to represent its members.  Although membership of a union is not compulsory for any employee, a junior employee is treated as an automatic member of the relevant union until he expressly opts out of the union.  However, once an employee joins a union, his membership of the union is sufficient authority for the union to represent him in negotiations/collective bargaining with his employer with a view to “regulating the terms and conditions of his employment”.
Workers voluntarily join a union by signing a membership card or otherwise indicating their voluntary decision to join.  However, as indicated earlier, junior staff are presumed by law to belong automatically to any trade union duly registered to represent the interest of the junior staff of employer organisations operating in the relevant industry.  Any junior member of staff who does not wish to belong to the trade union must take the positive step of “opting out” of such union.  To “opt out” of a trade union, junior staff are required to (a) withdraw in writing from the relevant union, and (b) inform the employer in writing of his withdrawal from membership of the union.  On the other hand, senior staff are presumed not to be members of any trade union; they must “opt in” individually and in writing before they become members of any trade union.  (
Otunba Gabriel Oladipo Abijio v Promasidor (Nig.) Ltd
, Suit No. NICN/LA/602/2014;
Udoh v OHMB
(1990) 4 NWLR (Pt. 142) 52.)
Consultation/communications with employees subject to redundancies/reductions in force – legal requirements regarding information to be provided to employees; timelines; point at which notice of termination can/must be provided to employees (if applicable); documents which must be provided to employees or government; whether an agreement must be reached with an employee in order to subject him/her to employment termination
Section 20 of the Labour Act merely requires an employer to notify the trade union or workers’ representative of the reasons for and the extent of the redundancy before terminating the employment of its staff on account of redundancy.
Article 13 of the ILO Termination of Employment Convention 1982 (“ILO Convention No. 158”) not only requires an employer to give the aforesaid notice to the workers’ representatives but to also consult with them on measures to be taken to avert or minimise the resultant terminations and on measures to minimise the adverse effect of the eventual terminations on the affected workers.  Section 254C (2) of the Constitution of the Federal republic of Nigeria 1999 (“Constitution”) vests on the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (“NICN”) the jurisdiction to deal with any matter connected with or pertaining to the application of any international convention, treaty or protocol which Nigeria has ratified relating to labour, employment, workplace, industrial relations, or matters connected therewith.  Nigeria has not ratified ILO Convention No. 158, but section 254C(1)(f) of the Constitution enables the NICN to apply any of its provisions, which is pleaded and proved as international best practice.  Therefore, it should be safe for a company that wishes to terminate an employees’ employment to be guided by the more comprehensive provisions of the ILO Convention No. 158 on consultations and the contents thereof.
Paragraph 1 of article 13 of the ILO Convention No. 158 requires the employer to (a) provide the workers’ representatives concerned in good time with relevant information including the reasons for the terminations contemplated, the number and categories of workers likely to be affected and the period over which the terminations are intended to be carried out, and (b) give, in accordance with national law and practice, the workers’ representatives concerned, as early as possible, an opportunity for consultation on measures to be taken to avert or to minimise the terminations and measures to mitigate the adverse effects of any terminations on the workers concerned such as finding alternative employment.  In
National Union of Hotels and Personal Services Workers v Imo Concorde Hotels Ltd.
(1994) 1 NWLR (Pt. 320) 306
,
the Court of Appeal, while discussing the notification requirement under section 20 of the Labour Act, held that a trade union does not have a right of action against an employer who fails to notify it prior to implementation of a redundancy affecting its members.  However, given the provision of the Third Alteration Act which empowers the NICN to apply international best practices, the NICN is likely to decide otherwise under the present regime.
As a practical matter, the notification and consultation in this instance would, apart from providing evidence that the employer followed the procedure required by law, provide a good opportunity for the employer to communicate its present challenges to its employees.  By this communication, the affected employees would be persuaded that the employer’s decision is not arbitrary, whilst the employees who would not be affected by the terminations would not view the employer’s management with suspicion on account of the terminations.
Although the employer is required to consult with the workers’ representatives, it ultimately has the final decision as to what needs to be done.  The conditions upon which an employee may be declared redundant are usually contained in the collective agreement or contract of employment.  However, an employee does not have a general right not to be declared redundant beyond what is contained in the contract of employment or collective agreement.  This was the position of the apex court of Nigeria in
SPDCN v Nwawka
(2003) 6 NWLR (Pt.815) 184.
Meanwhile, it is best practice for the employer to enter into a separation and release agreement with each of the affected employees, especially for the purpose of obtaining a waiver of all present and future claims from each affected employee to eliminate the chance of post-implementation litigation inconsideration for an
ex gratia
payment to the affected employee.
Consultation/communications with employees subject to redundancies/reductions in force
The process of consulting with employees’ representatives or the affected employees is governed by the Labour Act and international best practices aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness.  Section 20(1)(a) of the Labour Act mandates that workers affected by redundancies must be informed through their representative or union about the reasons for and extent of the proposed redundancy exercise. International standards, such as the provisions of the ILO Convention No. 158, emphasise the timely provision of relevant information to workers’ representatives, including details about the terminations contemplated and the intended period over which the terminations will occur.
Ability of employer to change terms and conditions of employment and method(s) for doing so
Section 7(2) of the Labour Act provides for the possibility of effecting a change in the terms and conditions of employment during the subsistence of the contract of employment.  Under the provision, it suffices for the employer to give reasonable notice of the change to the affected employee.  Although the provision does not seem to give the employee a choice in the matter as to whether to accept the change or not, the affected employee would nevertheless have the choice of either accepting the change, expressly or by conduct,
i.e.
by continuing in his employment under the new terms (
Ajayi v Texaco Nig. Ltd
(1987) 9–11 SC), or rejecting the change by terminating the employment relationship under the relevant provisions of the contract of employment.  Notwithstanding the power of an employer to alter the terms of the contract of employment of an employee during the subsistence of the employment, the alteration to be made by the employer is only permissible to the extent that it is permitted by law.  It would also appear that Nigerian law would allow such an alteration only if the affected employee agreed to it.  Hence in
Ekeoma Ajah v Fidelity Bank plc
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/588/2017 decided on 14 May 2019), the court held that a new company policy, introduced after an employee had given notice of retirement and was waiting out the notice period, could not be implemented to apply to such employee.  However, failure by the employer and employee to agree on the change to the terms of the contract of employment may lead to the termination of the employment relationship.
Business protections and restrictive covenants
Employee duties of confidentiality (express and implied) and good faith
Duties of confidentiality are generally regulated by the express terms of the employment contract.  Similarly, save for terms usually implied into contracts by common law principles in the absence of express provisions on pertinent matters (such as trade customs, usual course of dealing, etc.), parties are usually held to the express terms of their contract.  There is no overriding requirement for either party to act in good faith and to act fairly, unless the circumstance is such that a party may be said to have come under a fiduciary relationship to the other in the specific matter.  This duty extends beyond the termination of employment and requires employees to act in good faith to protect the interests of their employer. Breaches of confidentiality, whether intentionally or inadvertently, can result in legal repercussions, disciplinary action, and reputational damage to the organisation.  Therefore, employees must adhere to confidentiality obligations, uphold ethical standards, and demonstrate good faith in preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information in the workplace.
Restrictive covenants: business interests that can be protected; types of restriction available; typical length of restriction; consideration to be provided; garden leave; and ability of the courts to amend defective covenants
Restrictive covenants are classified by the courts as covenants in restraint of trade.  The courts have consistently held that such clauses are
prima facie
illegal and unenforceable unless they are (a) reasonable for the purpose of protecting the business interest of the employer, and (b) not contrary to public policy (
Leontaritis v Nigerian Textile Mills Ltd
. (1967) NCLR 114,13).  In
iROKOtv.com Limited v Michael Ugwu
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/169/2015 decided on 12 November 2020).  The NICN towed a similar line when it held that “the reasonability test must satisfy three main conditions,
viz
– (a) the interest of the claimant; (b) the interest of the defendant; and (c) the interest of the public”.  The burden is on the employer to show that the particular covenant sought to be enforced satisfies the criteria for enforcement (
Andreas I. Koumoulis v Leventis Motors Ltd
(1973) 1 All NLR (Pt. 2) 144, 146).  The reasonableness of a covenant in restraint of trade is to be tested by reference to the position as of the date on which the covenant was made (
Tillman v Egon Zehnder Ltd.
(2019) UKSC 32).  What is reasonable depends on the facts of each case; the court is generally guided by (i) the scope of the restraint imposed on the defendant in terms of its geographical ambit and the comprehensiveness of the business from which the defendant is restrained, and (ii) the duration of the restraint (
Anglo-African Supply Co. Ltd v John Benvie
(1937) 13 NLR 158) – section 68(1)(e) of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2018 provides for a period not exceeding two years.
It used to be the case that once a covenant in restraint of trade was found to be unreasonable by the court in relation to any of the relevant factors, the covenant would be struck down in its entirety, notwithstanding that some parts of it were reasonable.  However, the current state of the law as shown in the decision of the UK Supreme Court in the
Tillman
case (
supra
) is that where parts of such a covenant are reasonable whilst other parts are unreasonable, the unreasonable parts are severed from the covenant whilst the reasonable parts are enforced, provided that (a) the unreasonable parts are capable of being severed without the need to add to or modify the wording of the remainder, and (b) the severance will not generate any major change in the overall effect of the covenant.  Although the
Tillman
case is a foreign authority, which only has a persuasive effect on Nigerian courts, it is likely that the NICN will be persuaded by it on this point and/or will follow the authority as representing the international best practice on the point (if the position of the UK court in the case is pleaded and proved as such), relying on section 254C(1)(f) of the Constitution, which it has interpreted as vesting it with the power to apply international best practices in the determination of matters before it (
Aloysius v Diamond Bank Plc
[2015] 58 NLLR (Pt. 199) 92, 134).  The NICN has applied the principle in the
Tillman
case in
Samson Systems & Investment Limited v Nabih Chamchoum
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/87/2015 decided on 13 March 2019).
Discrimination and retaliation protection
Protected characteristics
Generally, the protected characteristics are personal traits, which include age, gender, marital status, disability, religion, race, colour, nationality, family situation, union affiliation, health, ethnic or national origin.  (Order 14 (2) of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (Civil Procedure) Rules 2017 (“NICN Rules”).)   The Constitution prohibits discrimination of Nigerian citizens on the bases of community, ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion, as well as recognising the right of citizens to equal opportunities for securing adequate means of livelihood and suitable employment (sections 42 and 17(3)(a) of the Constitution).  It is, however, the responsibility of the State to ensure national integration by providing adequate facilities and equal opportunities to all citizens without discrimination.  The HIV and Aids (Anti-Discrimination) Act 2014 further prohibits discrimination of employees by employers based on real or perceived HIV status or HIV-related illness.  The Discrimination Against Persons with Disability (Prohibition) Act 2018 prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities.  The Lagos State Special Peoples Law 2011, which only applies in Lagos State, also prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee’s disability.
Different types of discrimination/retaliation claims (e.g. direct, indirect, harassment & victimisation, etc.)
All forms of discrimination including harassment and victimisation, whether direct or indirect, are prohibited.  There are currently no specialised rules relating to sexual harassment in Nigeria.  However, Order 14, rule 1 of the NICN Rules provides for acts that constitute sexual harassment, namely (a) physical conduct of a sexual nature, (b) verbal form of sexual harassment, (c) non-verbal form of sexual harassment, and (d)
quid pro quo
harassment.  The criminal code laws of various States in Nigeria also make sexual harassment a criminal offence.  In addition, Nigeria recently ratified the Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019 (“ILO Convention No. 190”), which recognises the right of every person to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment.
Further, if an employer became aware of a workplace sexual harassment incident and took no administrative decision to investigate and address it, such employer may be liable for breaching its duty of care owed to the employee.  In
Ejike Maduka v Microsoft & ors
(2014) 41 NLLR (Pt 125) 67, the court held that an employer was liable for the acts of harassment against the employee where the employer failed to conclude investigations of the alleged case of sexual harassment.  In a subsequent decision in
Dorothy Adaeze Awogu v TFG Real Estate Limited
(unreported decision of NICN in Suit No NICN/LA/262/2013 decided on 4 June 2018), the NICN awarded
N
2,500,000 damages against an employer for physical harassment and discrimination of the employee at work.  Considering the foregoing, employers are advised to develop a workplace policy on harassment and victimisation of any form.  This policy should provide a mechanism for employees to report such actions, the procedure for investigating any such allegations, and the consequences of breaching the policy.
Burden of proof
Most discrimination claims instituted in the NICN are carried out within the context of wrongful termination of the employment contract.  By Order 14(2) and (3) of the NICN Rules, a claimant who alleges workplace discrimination shall state the grounds for the allegation, and indicate the activity (including the mode, manner, correspondence, and communication) that constitutes the alleged workplace discrimination.  The burden of proof is therefore on the employee who filed the claims to prove on the balance of probability that his/her employer terminated the contract of employment by way of discrimination against the employee.
Defence to discrimination
Where discrimination is pleaded as a basis for a claim of wrongful termination of the employment contract, an employer may be able to defend the claim by proving that the employee’s employment was terminated in accordance with the terms of his contract of employment or any other applicable law.  However, this defence would not avail an employer in proceedings in which the allegation of discrimination is an independent claim.
Compensation and other remedies
Where a discrimination claim within the context of wrongful termination of employment is successful, the remedy available to the employee would be compensation for wrongful termination.  The court may also award damages to the employee.  However, the NICN has reinforced its disposition to award general damages in actions for breach of employment contracts in deserving cases.  Thus, in
Emana Edet v Fidelity Bank Plc
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/276/2014 decided on 17 December 2019), the Court noted the usual position of the law that the damages are generally recoverable for wrongful termination of employment was limited to the usual remuneration for period of notice under the contract; the court, however, drew a distinction between damages for wrongful termination where no notice is given, and damages for an alleged malpractice such as injurious falsehood, relying heavily on the maxim,
ubi jus, ibi remedium
(where there is right there is a remedy).  Also, the NICN in a recent decision has held that once a case of constructive dismissal is established, the claimant will be entitled to an award of general damages (
Lucia Balonwu v Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) International
(unreported decision of NICN in NICN/ABJ/280/2018 decided on 22 July 2020) (“
Lucia Balonwu
case”)).  In
Onuhikemi v Smridu Nigeria Limited
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/265/2015 decided on 15 July 2016), the NICN awarded to an employee 24 months’ salary in the sum of
N
739,200 as general damages,
N
30,800 equivalent to a one-month salary
in lieu
of notice, and costs of
N
100,000.
Equal pay
The Constitution recognises the duty of the State to ensure equal pay for equal work without discrimination on account of sex or any other ground (section 17(3)(f) of the Constitution).  A Labour Standards Bill, which has provisions and an implementation mechanism for “equal pay for equal work”, was submitted in the National Assembly in 2008, is yet to be passed into law.  Nevertheless, the National Industrial Court has upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work.  Thus, in
Uzo Ejekwumadu v Blue Arrow TSW Limited
(unreported Suit No. NICN/LA/242/2016, judgment delivered on 18 March 2021), the NICN held that wage and benefit disparity between local employees and foreign staff is discriminatory and an unfair labour practice.  (See also
Iseh Peter v Sterling Global Oil Exploration
(unreported Suit No. NICN/ YEN/42/ 2018, judgment delivered on September 30, 2021.)
Confidentiality and the use of non-disclosure agreements (“NDAs”)
An NDA is a contract designed to protect a company’s confidential information or trade secrets disclosed to an employee.  Whilst an NDA has a legitimate purpose as aforesaid and is binding on an employee, it cannot prevent an employee from cooperating with governmental agencies for the purpose of reporting sexual harassment (and similar offences) or filing an action in court in respect thereof.  Thus, an employer cannot rely on an NDA to prevent an employee from reporting sexual harassment or causing a court action to be filed in respect thereof.
Whether or not attorneys’ fees are recoverable for claims of discrimination or retaliation
Recent decisions in Nigeria indicate a shift towards considering claims for solicitor’s fees as part of recoverable costs, particularly when properly pleaded and proved as special damages.  For instance, in
Naude & ors v Simon
(2013) LPELR-20491 (CA), the Court of Appeal acknowledged the evolving nature of the law on this issue and emphasised that solicitor’s fees, if reasonably incurred and properly proved, could be awarded as damages.  However, whilst there is a growing trend towards recovery of solicitor’s fees as recoverable costs, it is subject to judicial discretion and the specific circumstances of each case.
Whether or not independent contractors are protected by anti-discrimination and retaliation laws
Although independent contractors in Nigeria do not have the same level of protection against discrimination and retaliation as employees, the Nigerian Constitution provides a general safeguard against discrimination on any of the bases set out in the Constitution.  However, the terms of contract between the independent contractor and the nature of services provided by the independent contractor may determine whether an independent contractor receives protection against discrimination and retaliation as an employee.  The NICN will look at the substance of the relationship and will provide the same level of protection against discrimination and retaliation available to an employee to an independent contractor if the substance of the relationship is more of an employment relationship than a relationship between an entity and an independent contractor.
Protection against dismissal
Potentially fair reasons for dismissal
In the past, it used to be settled law in Nigeria that an employer could generally terminate an employment contract “
for good or bad reason, or for no reason at all
” so long as the employee’s employment did not have statutory flavour (
Olafimihan v Nova Lay-Tech Ltd
[1998] 4 NWLR (Part 547) 608, 621); however, in 2015, the NICN decided in
Aloysius v Diamond Bank Plc
[2015] 58 NLLR (Pt. 199) 92 that termination must be for a “valid reason” even for an employee whose employment did not have statutory flavour.  The court relied on article 4 of the ILO  Convention No. 158 and Recommendation No. 166, to hold that international best practice on termination required the employer to give a valid reason which must be either connected with the employee’s capacity, conduct, or based on the operational requirements of the undertaking, establishment, or service.  In coming to that conclusion, the court took the view that ILO Conventions or other Labour Standards represented international best practices.  This decision of the NICN was re-echoed by the court in
Bello Ibrahim v Ecobank Plc
(unreported decision of NICN in NICN/ABJ/144/2018 decided on 17 December 2019).
However, in
Emana Edet v Fidelity Bank Plc
(
supra
) (“
Edet
case”), which was also decided on 17 December 2019, the NICN held that although it is empowered to apply international best practices in cases before it, such international best practice must be properly pleaded and proven by the claimant before it may be applied by the court.  The effect of the decision in the
Edet
case is, therefore, that the requirement to give “valid reason” for termination of employment would be applied by the NICN only if it is pleaded and proven in a case before the NICN as international best practice either in the case before the court or a previous case by virtue of which the court may take judicial notice of that requirement.  We are also aware that the NICN has decided several terminations of employment suits, without considering the requirement to give a valid reason – although it may also be argued that the requirement was not urged on the court in those cases by the claimants.  Be that as it may, the NICN recently reiterated the position of the law that once the employer has given any reason at all for termination of employment, it is obligated to justify same when challenged in court (
Mr. Peter Enamona Adejo v Arksego Nigeria Limited
(unreported decision of NICN in NICN/ABJ/354/2017 decided on 27 May 2020)).  Generally, fair reasons for dismissal of an employee include, but are not limited to, allegation of crime, gross misconduct, redundancy, breach of conduct, inability to work, negligence in carrying out responsibilities (
Yusuf v UBN
(1996) 6 NWLR (Pt.457) 632) or unauthorised absence from work (
Udegbunam v FCDA
(2003) 10 NWLR (Pt. 829) 487).
Circumstances when dismissals can be automatically unfair
Dismissal of an employee for being a member of a trade union or participating in trade union activities outside working hours, and dismissing a woman during her period of absence due to pregnancy or confinement or such longer period due to illness resulting from her pregnancy or confinement are circumstances when dismissals can be deemed automatically unfair (
Mrs. Folarin Oreka Maiya v The Incorporated Trustees of Clinton Health Access Initiative, Nigeria & 2 ors
[2012] NLLR (Part 76) 110).  In
Mrs. Amaechi Lauretta Onyekachi v Stanqueen Investment Ltd
. (unreported judgment in Suit No. NICN/LA/271/2014, delivered on December 4, 2015).  The claimant refused to resign when she was asked to resign because she applied for maternity leave.  The employer issued her a notice of redundancy and terminated her employment, upon which, she claimed monetary reliefs for constructive dismissal and the court found in her favour.
Circumstances of unfair dismissal may also arise in the case of constructive dismissal.  Constructive dismissal occurs where an employer, by words or conduct, procures or attempts to procure the compulsory resignation or early retirement of an employee from his employment with the employer.  In
Mr. Adelabu Patrick
Olasumbo v Ecobank Nigeria Limited
(unreported decision of NICN in Suit No. NICN LA/257/2016 decided on 10 May 2017), the court held that the indefinite suspension of an employee without pay amounts to constructive dismissal of the employee.
Process to be followed when dismissing
It would appear that payment
in lieu
of notice must be made on the effective date of termination in a case in which an employer exercises that option (
Kayode Tijani v FRA Williams (Jr)
, unreported decision of NICN in NICN/LA/130/2015 decided on 9 July 2019 – a decision in which the court indicated that it relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in
Chukwumah v Shell Petroleum
(1993) LPELR 864 (SC) 1).  There are, however, Supreme Court decisions, which are later in time than the decision in
Chukwumah v Shell Petroleum
(
supra
), which suggest that the rule, assuming such rule was indeed established in the
Chukwumah
case, was not an absolute rule, but one which depended on the facts of the case.  In
Oforishe v NGC Ltd
(2018) 12 NWLR (1602) 35 (a decision subsequent to
Chukwumah v Shell
), the Supreme Court held that the termination in the case was lawful even though the salary
in lieu
of notice was not paid on the effective date or at all, since the salary
in lieu
of notice was available for collection but was not or never collected by the employee.  Indeed, in the
Chukwumah
case, the Justices of the Supreme Court did not agree on the point.  Bello CJN disagreed with Ogundare JSC and held that the mode and time of payment depended on the circumstance of each case, citing earlier decisions, such as
Morohunfola v Kwara State College of Technology
(1986) 4 NWLR (Pt. 38) 732,
Ajayi v Texaco Nigeria Ltd.
(1987) 3 NWLR (Pt. 62) 577, and
Olaniyan & ors. v University of Lagos
(1985) 2 NWLR (Pt. 9) 559.  Further, in the
Chukwumah
case, Karibi-Whyte JSC held that the point did not arise for determination in that case because it was not the case of the plaintiff/applicant that his termination was wrongful because the payment
in lieu
of notice was not paid on the effective date of the termination.
An employer may, however, consider the impact of the decision in
Kayode Tijani v FRA Williams (Jr)
(
supra
) in making a decision to terminate an employee by payment
in lieu
of notice.
In dismissing an employee, the employer is required to follow (a) the procedure set out in the contract of employment (if any), or (b) the procedure set by statute where the contract is governed by statute (
Nigeria Airways Limited v Okutubo
(2002) 15 NWLR (Pt. 790) 376).  In both cases, the employer must grant fair hearing to the employee.
Compensation and other remedies available for wrongful dismissal
The court may grant specific damages (which include accrued salaries, payments
in lieu
of notice, if applicable, and other entitlements), general damages, or reinstatement (this is applicable where the employment has statutory flavour such as public servants) in the event of wrongful or unlawful dismissal.  In
Lovell Osahon Ehigie v First Bank of Nigeria
(unreported decision of NICN in NICN/PHC/137/2017 decided on 30 September 2021), the court awarded the sum of
N
20 million against the defendant as general damage for wrongful dismissal and acts of unfair labour practice against an employee.  Similarly, in
Mrs. Sharon Philip v Notore Chemical Industries Limited
(unreported decision of NICN in NICN/YEN/56/2015 decided on 29 July 2022), the court awarded
N
7,500,000 against the defendant as general damages for subjecting the claimant to workplace victimisation and for wrongful termination.  In addition to the award of damages (which could be determined by his lost income during the period of his purported dismissal), the court may also order the reinstatement of an employee whose employment was terminated in breach of a statute (
CBN v Igwillo
(2007) LPELR-835).
Whether or not wrongful dismissal claims are subject to arbitration or other forms of alternative dispute resolution
In
Giuseppe Francesco E. Ravelli v Digitsteel integrated Services Limited
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No. NICN/LA/599/2016 delivered on 16 February 2018) the NICN held that it is not enabled by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (“ACA”) (now repealed and replaced by the Arbitration and Mediation Act), the Trade Disputes Act (“TDA”), and the Constitution to apply the ACA, and that the ACA did not apply to employment disputes.  However, in our opinion, that case did not decide the question of arbitrability of employment disputes in Nigeria.
However, by the National Industrial Court Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) Centre Instrument 2015, the NICN established the Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (“ADR Centre”) in the premises of the NICN.  The ADR Centre is established to essentially resolve disputes between parties arising from labour, employment, industrial relations, etc. between parties through the process of mediation and/or conciliation. The matters that qualify for referral to the ADR Centre include wrongful dismissal claims.
The TDA also contains provisions for arbitration of trade disputes.
Statutory employment protection rights
Mandatory/statutory notice periods
Other than employees whose employment is governed by the Labour Act and except as specifically provided by statute, which governs any specific employment, the notice period for termination is a matter of contract.  For employment government by the Labour Act, the minimum length of notice to be given to an employee is as follows: (a) one day’s notice where the contract has continued for a period of three months or less; (b) one week’s notice where the contract has continued for a period more than three months but less than two years; (c) two weeks’ notice where the contract has continued for a period more than two years but less than five years; and (d) one month’s notice where the contract has continued for five years or more (section 11 of the Labour Act).  However, these provisions do not preclude an employer and employee from agreeing to a longer notice period under the relevant contracts of employment.
Restrictions on working time and in particular the right to annual leave
The Labour Act prescribes the minimum terms and conditions of employment that employers must comply with in relation to hours of work, holiday and holiday pay, and sick leave requirements.  The normal hours of work shall be fixed: by mutual agreement; or by collective bargaining within the organisation or industry concerned; or by an industrial wages board where there is no machinery for collective bargaining (section 13(1) of the Labour Act).  Also, where a worker is at work for six hours or more a day, his work shall be interrupted by allowing one or more suitably spaced rest-intervals of not less than one hour on the aggregate (section 13(3) of the Labour Act).
Subject to the provision of section 18 of the Labour Act, a worker is entitled to annual leave of at least six working days with full salary.  The annual leave is increased to at least 12 working days for young workers (under the age of 16 years) including apprentices.  A worker must have worked for at least 12 months to qualify for annual leave.  Annual leave must be taken at the end of the year in which it is earned; however, it may be deferred by mutual agreement provided that the holiday earning period must not exceed 24 months and the deferred leave must be taken within 24 months.  If an employee is dismissed after less than 12 months of continuous employment, they must be paid a
pro rata
amount of holiday pay for their accrued annual leave.
There is no statutory provision for overtime pay, bonus and commission, thus, such compensation is entirely a matter of mutual agreement or collective bargaining agreement.
By section 16 of the Labour Act, an employee shall be entitled to paid sick leave of up to 12 working days in any calendar year.
Leave for employees whose employment is not governed by the Labour Act is a matter of contract, including collective bargaining.  However, the provisions of the Labour Act provide a guide.
Family-friendly rights
Maternity leave
: By section 54 of the Labour Act, a woman shall (i) have the right to leave her work if she produces a medical certificate given by a registered medical practitioner stating that her confinement will probably take place within six weeks, and (ii) not be permitted to work during the six weeks following her confinement.  And if she is absent from her work on the bases of the foregoing and had been continuously employed by her employer for a period of six months or more immediately prior to her absence, she shall be paid not less than 50% of the wages she would have earned if she had not been absent.  Maternity leave can be extended in cases of illness arising out of pregnancy or confinement, which made the relevant employee unfit for work.  In Lagos State, the duration for maternity leave has been increased from three months to six months with full pay for its public service employees.  In
Mrs. Ekwelem Chinenye v Acron Medical Consultant Limited
(unreported decision of the NICN in Suit No.: NICN/YEN/25/2017 delivered on 3 May 2019), the NICN has held that the provisions of the Labour Act on maternity leave apply to all categories of employees in Nigeria – and are not limited to employees defined as “worker” under the Labour Act.
Paternity leave
: The Labour Act does not provide for paternity leave.  Thus, such entitlement would be subject to the terms and conditions of an employee’s contract of employment.  However, by the Public Service Rules 2021, male federal civil servants are entitled to 14 days’ paternity leave.  Lagos State government also approved a 10-working day paternity leave for male civil servants, which applies in respect of the first two children.  Paternity leave duration in Enugu State is three weeks.
Flexible working hours
: There are no statutory provisions to this effect.  Provision for flexible working hours is at the discretion of the employer, and if granted will be subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant contract of employment.
Special protections for workers against detriment/dismissal
There are a few pieces of domestic legislation for the protection of whistleblowers in Nigeria.  They include: (a) section 27(2)(a) and (b) of Freedom of Information Act, 2011, which provides against the prejudicial effect of any provision of the Criminal Code or Official Secret Act against a person who discloses information, which he reasonably believes to show mismanagement, gross waste of funds, and abuse of authority, or a danger to health and safety; (b) section 5.3 of the Central Bank of Nigeria Code of Corporate Governance for Banks and Discount Houses in Nigeria 2014, which provides for banks to have a whistleblowing policy to be made known to the employees and stakeholders, and the policy to include assurance of confidentiality for the report of unethical activity; and (c) section 64 of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Act 2000, which provides that an officer of the Commission should keep as a secret the identity of a person who gave him information upon which a complaint was made.  Currently, there is a Bill pending before the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of Nigeria called
Whistle Blower Protection Bill 2019.
The Bill, which passed its first reading at the floor of the House on 16 July 2019, would, when enacted into law, provide holistic protection for whistleblowers, providing, amongst others, punishment for employers that punish employees for whistleblowing.  Such punitive provisions will help to avert unpleasant experiences like that of Olu Ibirogba.  In
Olu Ibirogba v The Council, the Federal Polytechnic Yaba
[2015] 63 NLLR (Pt. 223) 343, the claimant, the College Bursar, was suspended for whistleblowing on the defendant, his employer.  On the date the judgment was being read in the case, his employer terminated his employment.  He filed another suit challenging his termination since the verdict of this court was that his suspension was invalid and he was ordered to resume work.  This ensuing suit,
Olu Ibirogba v The Council of the Federal Polytechnic Yaba & 2 ors
(unreported Suit No. NICN/LA/473/2015, the judgment of which was delivered on 7 June 2018), went his way and his reinstatement was ordered.
Worker consultation, trade unions and industrial action
Worker consultation
Although there is no statutory requirement in Nigeria for employers to consult their employees before making business decisions, an employer will, however, be required to consult an employee if consultation is required under the employment contract between the employer and the employee, or where the situation is such that the employer intends to use the personal data of the employee otherwise than as agreed in the contract of employment.  Where an employee seeks to use the personal data of an employee as aforesaid or where the employer intends to share same with a third party for any reason, the employer is required under the recently enacted Nigeria Data Protection Act (“NDPA”) and the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (“NDPR”) to consult the employee and obtain consent.
Trade union and industrial action
Section 40 of the Constitution guarantees every Nigerian the freedom to assemble freely, associate with any person, form or belong to any trade union or any association.  However, section 2 of the TUA prohibits an unregistered trade union from functioning, while sections 3, 4 and 5 make provision for the process and procedure for registration of trade unions.
Industrial actions include a picket, strike, etc. and are embarked on by employees and/or trade unions for the failure of employers to honour collective agreements, demand for salary and wage increase, protest against unreasonable policies by employers, etc.  However, controversy exists over the right of the worker, employee, or trade union to take part in a strike, lock-out, etc. in view of the provisions of sections 4, 6, 18(1) and (2) and 43(1) of the TDA, section 31(6)I of TUA and section 1 of the Trade Disputes (Essential Services) Act (“TDESA”).  The provisions of the TDA create a mandatory requirement for a trade union to first explore an amicable settlement of any dispute it may have with an employer, failing which the dispute shall be reported to the Minister, before embarking on a strike (sections 4, 5 and 18(1)(a) of the TDA).  The TDA further provides that where a worker takes part in a strike, such worker will not be entitled to any wages or remuneration for the period of the strike amongst other disabilities (section 43(1)(a) of the TDA).  The TDESA empowers the President to proscribe any trade union or association that embarks in any industrial action, which disrupts the economy or disrupts the smooth running of an essential service.  However, in
Federal Government of Nigeria & anor v Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) & anor
(unreported Suit No. NICN/ABJ/179/2016, the judgment was delivered on 15 July 2016), the NICN held that strikes, lock-out or any industrial action as provided for in section 7(1)(b) of the NICN Act are not caught by the provision of section 7(3) of the NICN Act, which requires a party to go through the process of conciliation or arbitration before it can be heard by the court.  Consequently, the worker, trade union or association is not required to go through the dispute resolution processes of Part I of the TDA as a condition precedent to embarking on a strike, picket or lock-out.  The NICN had also in that case upheld the right of workers to embark on a strike in opposition to a government policy.  However, in
Oshiomhole & anor v FGN & anor
(2006) LPELR-7570 (CA), the Court of Appeal had held that political considerations, opposition to government policy such as fuel tax, are not trade disputes upon which the appellants have any right to protest as they had nothing to do with the terms and conditions of employment of the workers and do not constitute trade dispute properly.
Employee privacy
Data protection rights for employees and obligations for employers
Section 37 of the Constitution provides for the protection of the right of a citizen to privacy and the privacy of his home, correspondence, telephone conversations and telegraphic communication.  The NDPA is, however, the substantive legislation on data protection and data privacy in Nigeria.  The NDPR and the NDPR Implementation Framework are subsidiary legislation, which apply pursuant to the NDPA.  The NDPA provides, amongst other things, that the lawful bases for the processing of personal data of a data subject under the NDPA are (a) consent of the data subject, and (b) the fact that the processing  of the data is necessary for (i) performance of contract, (ii) compliance with legal obligation, (iii) protection of vital interest, (iv) performance of task in public interest or exercise of authority vested in the data controller or data processor, and (v) legitimate interest pursued by the data controller or data processor or third party.  An employee is entitled to the protections provided by the NDPA.  In
Incorporated Trustees of Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative & ors v NIMC
(2021) LPELR-55623(CA), the Court of Appeal held that personal data protection under the NDPR falls under the right to privacy guaranteed by section 37 of the Constitution.
Regarding the transfer of employee data outside Nigeria, the NDPA provides for a new and flexible regime for cross-border transfer of personal data, which dispenses with the supervisory role of the Attorney General of the Federation as provided in the NDPR.  Section 41(1) of the NDPA provides for the existence of an adequate level of protection under law, binding corporate rule or contractual clauses, code of conduct or certification mechanism as the legal basis for cross-border transfer of personal data.  The existence of an adequate level of protection is assessed by whether the law the data recipient is subject to or other legal instrument a data controller is relying on as providing an adequate level of protection upholds principles that are substantially similar to the conditions of processing data provided in the NDPA.  Specific criteria for determining adequacy are provided in section 42(2) of the NDPA.  These criteria include (a) availability of enforceable data subject rights, (b) existence of a legal instrument between the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (“NDPC”) and a competent authority in the recipient jurisdiction that ensures adequate data protection, (c) existence of effective data protection law, and (d) international commitments and conventions binding on the relevant country and its membership of any multilateral or regional organisations.  The discretion of the NDPC to designate a country as having adequate level of protection (as provided in the NDPR where NITDA published a whitelist of countries or regions with adequate level of protection) is retained under section 42(4) of the NDPA.  This means that countries on the whitelist published by the NITDA and adopted by the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau are still deemed to have an adequate level of data protection.
Other than adequacy of protection, a data controller may transfer personal data on the basis that (a) the data subject has consented to the transfer, (b) the processing of the data is necessary for the performance of a contract or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, (c) the transfer is for the sole benefit of the data subject, and it is not practicable to obtain the consent of the data subject, and where it is likely practicable to obtain the consent, the data subject would give the consent, (d) transfer is necessary for important public interest, (e) transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or (f) transfer is necessary to protect the vital interest of the data subject or other persons where the data subject does not have the legal capacity to give consent (section 43(1) of NDPA).
Monitoring/surveillance in the workplace (e.g. CCTV, monitoring email/internet use and telephone calls)
An employer may monitor the workplace and work performance by fixing CCTV, monitoring email correspondence and internet use and telephone calls, which are strictly official.  However, an employer cannot monitor private email correspondence, internet use and telephone calls of an employee; such will violate the employee’s privacy right.  However, a fair restriction on internet use and phone calls during working hours by an employer does not violate any known law.
Vetting and background checks
An employer may vet or do background checks on a potential employee.  However, the Regulation requires that where such vetting or checks require that the employer should acquire the personal data of the person, the purpose should be made known to the person.  Where such data are acquired, the employer is put under the burden to protect them and use them in line with the NDPA.  The vetting and checks must not also violate the person’s constitutional right to privacy.
Drug testing and other forms of testing in the workplace
Generally, an employer may carry out drug tests and other forms of testing in the workplace, except where a law specifically prohibits a form of test.  Section 8 of the Labour Act provides for a mandatory medical examination for every worker who enters into a contract at the expense of the employer, except for workers specifically exempted under section 8(2).  Also, section 10 of the HIV and AIDS (Anti-Discrimination) Act 2014 provides that HIV and AIDS testing in a workplace can only be at the instance of an employee; an employer cannot therefore subject an employee to a HIV and AIDS test without the employee’s consent.  Furthermore, any such testing at the instance of an employee is required to comply with the National HIV Counseling Testing Guidelines.
Adewunmi Akinola v Ocean Marine Solutions Limited
(unreported judgment in Suit No. NICN/LA/410/2019, delivered on 25 October 2021).
Other recent developments in the field of employment and labour law
The role of alternative dispute resolution in employment disputes
The TDA requires disputing parties to first embark on mediation within seven days of the date in which a dispute arose.  Where the mediator fails to achieve settlement within seven days, the dispute is reported in writing by the mediator to the Minster of Labour.  The disputing parties are also expected to file the trade disputes form together with the mediation report to the Minister of Labour.  Further, under the NICN Rules, a judge may refer any matter instituted at the NICN to the ADR Centre established within the NICN premises for amicable settlement.  The Centre shall endeavour to conclude the mediation or conciliation process within 21 working days from the date the process commences, with an extension period of not more than 10 working days.  Where parties are unable to settle, the NICN will hear the matter in accordance with its Rules.
Worker status
The Labour Act defines a “worker” as “any person who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer, whether the contract is for manual labour or clerical work is expressed or implied or oral or written, and whether it is a contract of service or a contract personally to execute any work or labour”.  A “worker” under the Labour Act does not include: any person employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer’s business; persons exercising administrative, executive, technical or professional functions as public officers or otherwise; or members of the employer’s family; representatives, agents and commercial travellers; any person to whom articles or materials are given out to be made or cleaned; or any person employed in a vessel or aircraft.  There is, however, no definition of “employee” in the Labour Act.
Jurisdictional issues
In the
Lucia Balonwu
case, decided by the NICN on 22 July 2020, the court had occasion to review the controversial and conflicting case law on the jurisdiction of the court over the tort of defamation and concluded on the basis of a more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in
Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria v Dr Alfred Ehigiegba
[2018] LPELR-44972(CA), that the court has jurisdiction over claims for defamation in the workplace.
Training
The Industrial Training Fund (“ITF”) Act established a Fund to be utilised to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills in industry or commerce with a view to generating a pool of indigenously trained workers.  Contributions to the Fund are made by employers and the Federal Government.  The Fund is deployed by the ITF Governing Council to develop courses and provide facilities for training persons employed or prospective employees in industry and commerce.  The ITF Act imposes an obligation on employers who pay an annual training levy to provide adequate training for their indigenous staff with a view to improving on the skills related to their job and evidence of such training is required to be forwarded to the Governing Council.  Such employers are also expected to accept students for industrial attachment purposes.
Other than the mandatory contribution to the ITF, there are no statutory requirements for training employees.  However, an employer may at his discretion cover the cost of an employee’s continuous education and training on the condition that the skill acquired by the employee will be applied to the business of the employer.  An employer may, however, require an employee to sign an undertaking to remain in their service for a specified period of time after the acquisition of new skills in consideration for the employer paying for the related training.  The court will enforce such undertaking if the terms are fair and reasonable (
Overland Airways Limited v Captain Raymond Jam
(2015) 62 NLLR (Pt. 219) 525;
Dr. Victor F. Balogun & 2 ors v federal University of Technology Akure & Anor
(unreported decision of NICN in Suit No NICN/AK/49/2015 decided on 15 November 2018)).
National minimum wage levels
The National Minimum Wage Act provides that the minimum wage an employer is expected to pay the lowest paid worker in any establishment is the sum of
N
30,000 monthly subject to statutory deductions.  However, the set minimum wage does not apply where (a) workers are employed on a part-time basis or paid by commission or in piece rate, (b) the employer has less than 25 workers, (c) workers are engaged in seasonal employment such as agriculture, and (d) persons are employed in a vessel or aircraft.  The Minster of Labour has the discretion to add to the list of workers or establishments exempted from the minimum wage.
This current minimum wage is set to expire after five years (i.e. 2024) and is subject to review by the tripartite committee consisting of representatives of the government, organised labour, and the private sector.  However, on 31 January 2024, the committee was inaugurated to recommend a new minimum wage, considering social justice and equity, and to present its findings as an executive bill to the National Assembly.
Trends in executive compensation
The law that primarily governs executive compensation in Nigeria is the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020 (“CAMA”), which applies to all companies incorporated in Nigeria.  The Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance (“NCCG”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council which applies to public companies and regulated private companies, also provides directives on the remuneration of directors.  Section 293 of CAMA confers the power of determining the remuneration of directors on the shareholders and that of a managing director on the directors of the company.  CAMA further provides guidance on the nature of expenses, in respect of which a director can seek to be reimbursed and the basis for paying directors’ fees where the company has not entered into a contract with the director.  The NCCG requires each company to disclose its remuneration policy in the company’s annual report and prohibits managing directors and executive directors from being involved in the determination of their remuneration and that of any director of the company.  NCCG also provides that the remuneration of managing directors and executive directors should link rewards to corporate and individual performances and prohibits the payment of directors’ fees or sitting allowances to the managing directors and executive directors.
The compensation of other executives, who are not directors of a company, is a matter of contract between the company and the executive and is not regulated by any law.
