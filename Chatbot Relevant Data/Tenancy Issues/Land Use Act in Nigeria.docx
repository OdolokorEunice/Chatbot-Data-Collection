Understanding the Land Use Act in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Guide
Land Use Act of 1978
is one of the most important legal frameworks governing land ownership and management in Nigeria. The act vests control of all land within a state+AOIAgACZ-s territory in the governor of that state, effectively centralizing the authority to grant land rights. Understanding this law is crucial for anyone involved in land acquisition, property development, or
real estate investment
in
Nigeria
.
Historical Background: Land Ownership Before the Act
Before 1978, land ownership in Nigeria was primarily governed by a
customary land tenure system
. This system allowed traditional rulers, families, and communities to control land according to local customs and traditions. While this system worked in many rural areas, it created significant problems in urban and developing regions, especially as the country industrialized.
In urban areas, there was often confusion and inconsistency in land transactions, with multiple claims to ownership on the same piece of land. Moreover, the variety of customary laws across Nigeria+AOIAgACZ-s ethnic groups made it difficult to standardize land ownership rules. The Nigerian government recognized that without reform, this fragmented system would hinder economic growth, real estate development, and equitable access to land.
The Colonial Influence
During the colonial era, the British introduced laws to govern land ownership, but these laws largely coexisted with indigenous customs. For instance, the
Public Lands Ordinance
of 1903 allowed the government to take control of lands for public purposes, while still acknowledging customary ownership in many cases. This dual system of colonial and customary land laws persisted into post-independence Nigeria, creating a legal patchwork that was ripe for reform.
Urbanization and Industrialization
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Nigeria was experiencing rapid urbanization and industrial growth, especially in cities like Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano. With this expansion came a surge in land disputes, land speculation, and unequal access to land. Wealthy individuals and corporations were able to amass large tracts of land, while ordinary Nigerians faced barriers to ownership, further entrenching inequality.
It became clear that the government needed to create a unified framework that would standardize land ownership and make land accessible for development, agriculture, and residential purposes. This laid the groundwork for the creation of the
Land Use Act
.
Objectives of the Land Use Act
The
Land Use Act of 1978
was introduced with several key objectives in mind. The Nigerian government intended to
centralize land administration
, ensure that land was used for the public good, and simplify the complex land tenure systems that had previously existed.
1. Equitable Distribution of Land
One of the primary goals of the act was to ensure that land was available to all Nigerians, regardless of social or economic status. Before the act, wealthy individuals and corporations could easily acquire vast areas of land, making it difficult for small-scale farmers, rural dwellers, and ordinary citizens to access land. By vesting control of all land in the hands of the state governor, the act aimed to provide more equitable access to land resources.
For instance, under the Land Use Act, all land within a state+AOIAgACZ-s boundaries is now held +AOIAgACc-in trust+AOIAgACd- by the state governor, who allocates it based on the needs of the people. This move was intended to prevent land hoarding and speculation, making land available for more productive uses, such as agriculture, industry, and housing.
2. Centralized Land Control
The act also sought to eliminate the fragmented land tenure systems by centralizing land control under the state government. By doing so, it was hoped that land transactions would become more transparent, standardized, and easier to regulate.
Instead of individuals obtaining land directly from families or traditional rulers, they would now apply to the state government for rights of occupancy. This centralization aimed to reduce land disputes and ensure that land use aligned with the state+AOIAgACZ-s economic development plans.
3. Simplification of Land Transactions
Before the Land Use Act, land transactions were often cumbersome, requiring negotiations with multiple parties, including traditional leaders, families, and local officials. The act simplified this process by introducing the
Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)
, a legal document issued by the state governor that grants the holder the right to use a parcel of land for a specified period (usually
99 years
). This document serves as proof of legal land ownership or tenancy, making it easier for individuals and businesses to buy, sell, lease, or transfer land.
4. Regulating Land Use for Economic Development
Another important objective of the act was to ensure that land was used in ways that contributed to the country+AOIAgACZ-s economic growth. The Nigerian government recognized that land is a finite resource, and its improper allocation could stifle industrial and agricultural development. The
Land Use Act
allows the government to control land allocation in a manner that supports national development goals, such as urban planning, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation.

Key Provisions of the Land Use Act
The Land Use Act introduces several important provisions that affect property ownership and land rights in Nigeria:
A. State Ownership of Land
The act states that all land in each state is held in trust by the governor, who administers it for the benefit of the public. Individuals and corporations can only hold land through
grants of occupancy
from the state.
For example, If you want to acquire land for a residential building in Lagos, you need the governor+AOIAgACZ-s consent through a
Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)
. This document grants you the right to use the land, typically for a period of
99 years
.
B. Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent
One of the most critical aspects of the act is the requirement for
Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent
for any transfer, sale, or lease of land. This applies to both private and commercial transactions. Without the governor+AOIAgACZ-s approval, any land transaction is considered null and void under the law.
Note
: Inherited land or family land still requires the governor+AOIAgACZ-s consent when ownership is transferred to heirs. This is a common legal issue for families who assume that land automatically belongs to them without going through the formal process.
C. Customary Rights of Occupancy
In rural areas, where customary land tenure systems still exist, the act provides for
Customary Rights of Occupancy
. This means traditional rulers or local governments can allocate land to individuals for agricultural or residential purposes, but the rights must still be approved by the state.
D. Revocation of Land Rights
The governor has the power to revoke land rights for public purposes, such as building roads, schools, or hospitals. However, the law requires that compensation be provided to the affected landowners. The compensation is based on the value of unexhausted improvements (buildings, crops, etc.), rather than the land itself.
Implications for Property Owners and Investors
1. Limited Ownership
One of the most significant effects of the Land Use Act is that no individual or entity can claim
absolute ownership
of land. All land remains in the control of the state, meaning property owners only hold
rights of occupancy
for a specified period.
2. High Cost of Obtaining Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent
Getting the governor+AOIAgACZ-s consent for land transactions can be both time-consuming and expensive. The cost varies by state but generally ranges between
3+ACU- to 5+ACU-
of the property+AOIAgACZ-s value.
3. Complicated Land Transactions
The requirement for Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent makes land transactions in Nigeria more complex than in many other countries. Property deals must pass through layers of bureaucracy, and this can delay the completion of transactions by several months.
4. Land Use for Public Purpose
If the government decides that a particular piece of land is needed for public use, it can revoke occupancy rights. While compensation is required by law, disputes often arise over the valuation of properties and the fairness of the compensation.
Common Misconceptions About the Land Use Act
A. Customary Land Is Not Affected by the Land Use Act
One common misconception is that land held under customary law is exempt from the Land Use Act. This is not true. Customary land still falls under the purview of the governor, and holders of such land must still seek approval through Customary Rights of Occupancy.
B. Once You Have a Certificate of Occupancy, You Own the Land
Another misconception is that a
Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)
grants full ownership. In reality, a C of O only gives you the right to use the land for a specified period, typically
99 years
. After this period, the government may decide whether or not to renew your rights.
5. Challenges and Criticisms of the Land Use Act
The Land Use Act has faced several criticisms since its enactment. One major issue is the
centralization of power
in the hands of state governors, which has led to accusations of abuse and corruption. Critics argue that governors have too much control over land allocation, sometimes using their power for political gain or to enrich themselves.
Another challenge is the bureaucratic bottleneck the act creates. Obtaining Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent for every land transaction is seen as burdensome and can discourage investment. In fact, according to a report from
PwC
, the process of securing land titles in Nigeria is ranked among the most cumbersome in Africa, often taking between
3 to 12 months
to complete.
Proposed Reforms to the Land Use Act
In recent years, there have been calls to reform the Land Use Act to make it more efficient and equitable. Some of the proposed reforms include:
Decentralizing land control
: Allowing local governments to have more control over land allocation and reducing the governor+AOIAgACZ-s role in land transactions.
Streamlining the process for Governor+AOIAgACZ-s Consent
: Reducing the cost and time required to obtain consent for land transactions.
Improving compensation mechanisms
: Ensuring that compensation for revoked land rights is fair and timely, with better valuation methods.
